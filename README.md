**NOTE:**  This client library is for the SCORM Cloud V1 API, which is on a deprecation schedule.  The client library for SCORM Cloud's V2 API can be found [here](https://github.com/RusticiSoftware/scormcloud-api-v2-client-php).

# SCORM Cloud PHP API Bindings

This library provides implementations for the majority, but not all, of the
[SCORM Cloud API][1]. It is provided under the BSD 3-clause License (see
[LICENSE](LICENSE.md)).

You can sign up for a SCORM Cloud account at
[https://cloud.scorm.com](https://cloud.scorm.com).

See our [API quick start][1] guide for more information.

## Requirements

Requires PHP 5 or greater.

## Installation

This library is available [via Composer][2].

Command-line:

    composer require rustici-software/scorm-cloud

Composer.json:

    {
        "require": {
            "rustici-software/scorm-cloud": "dev-master"
        }
    }

Alternately, the top-level .php files can be included in your project.

### Configuration

The `ScormEngineService` class provides simple access to the API
bindings:

```php
$scormCloud = new ScormEngineService(
    "https://cloud.scorm.com/EngineWebServices",
    "your app id",
    "your secret key",
    "your origin string");
```

where *your app id* is the app ID in question, *your secret key* is a secret
key for that app ID, and *your origin string* is a company/app description.
(The origin string is used for debugging on the SCORM Cloud developers' side.)
See [API quick start][1] for information on app ID / secret keys.

## Example API Calls

Once installed and configured, it's time to make API calls. As explained in
the [quick start guide][1], the library implements the scaffolding used to
interact with the [actual web API][3].

The [samples](samples/) directory contains sample code for several API calls.
It's not required for the library to function.

### Registration Exists

Corresponds to [rustici.registration.exists][4].

```php
$exists = $scormCloud->getRegistrationService()->Exists("reg id");
```

### Create Registration

Corresponds to [rustici.registration.createRegistration][5].

```php
$scormCloud->getRegistrationService()->CreateRegistration(
    "registration id",
    "course id",
    "learner id",
    "learner first name",
    "learner last name");

```

As explained in the [LMS Integration Guide][6], the registration, course, and 
learner IDs are provided by your system. The course ID needs to be an ID
for a course that's already been imported. See the LMS integration guide for
more information about integrating a typical LMS with SCORM Cloud.

### Building Launch Link

As explained in [rustici.registration.launch][7], the launch API call is
different from nearly every other API call in that it's intended for integrating
systems to *redirect* learners to that API call URL instead of calling it
server-side.

The client library facilitates this by providing a `GetLaunchUrl` method:

```php
$launchUrl = $scormCloud->getRegistrationService()->GetLaunchUrl(
    "registration id",
    "redirect on exit url");

```
where *registration id* is the registration to launch and *redirect on exit url*
is the URL to which the learner should be redirected if they exit the course.
(Note: as discussed in the [LMS Integration Guide][6], don't rely on learners
hitting the redirect on exit URL.)

In a typical PHP web-app, you might redirect to this:

```php
header('Location: ' . $launchUrl);
die();
```

The library provides other (default null) parameters for GetLaunchUrl that
might be useful.

## Implementing Other API Calls

Although this library implements most of the SCORM Cloud API, it doesn't
implement all of it. In cases where the library is insufficient, you can use
the `ServiceRequest` class to directly call API methods described in the
[API reference][3]:

```php
$request = $scormCloud->CreateNewRequest();

$request->setMethodParams(array(
    'regid' => 'your reg id'
));

$response = $request->CallService("rustici.registration.exists");
$xml = simplexml_load_string($response);

$exists = ($xml->result == 'true');
```

This snippet of code manually builds a `ServiceRequest` with one parameter
and then uses `CallService` to invoke the request for a particular API method.

As it happens, this is (close to) the implementation of the RegistrationExists
method above.

If you find methods missing and would like to implement them, we would be
eternally grateful for any pull requests.
